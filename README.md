Merge style games take out the tiring clicker gameplay and swap it for merging items: drag and drop duplicate items on top of each other to increase their level. What's a simple premise turns into an addicting experience, because the game always feels like there is something to do. Sessions are impressively long because it's just so compelling to constantly build up your houses towards the next goal. The next goal is so clear (I want to upgrade my best house), and the path is clear (merge until I get a duplicate) — yet as soon as I complete a goal, I'm compelled to start the next path.

Idle Heroes has an important difference from similar games: Your heroes can not earn XP points that they can use for themselves by completing missions. These points only affect your personal level. In other words, the only way of leveling your heroes is to use gold and spirit points. Theoretically, as long as you have enough of these two sources, you can raise each hero to the last level in a matter of minutes without having to play for days. But we do not have unlimited resources: We have to win gold and spirit manually”.

It is a very enjoyable game though I wished we(the player) can merge different dragons to form combination elements and dragon. Also, can you add more elements to extend the number of elements other than 4, maybe add air or lightning to start with, then add more elements (combo or not) to every new update to the game. Otherwise, I'll enjoy it more.
